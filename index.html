        <h2> Mission Statement</h2>
        <p2>  There are plenty of times you wished you could get from Point A to Point B without having to own a car/calling a ride-hail service like Uber/Lyft.
            In the world of ever-increasing inflation on gas prices, there are environmental & infrastructure concerns over the viability of personal car/transport.
            In order to reduce congestion of public transport, there needs to be an app that makes it possible for a safer and more tension free form of transportation 
            that takes individuals to their destination. In order to alleviate the tensions of the masses, especially smaller towns, ShuttleHub propose a service in the form of an app that allows
            providers a location based service that helps providers safely transport users from one place to another.
